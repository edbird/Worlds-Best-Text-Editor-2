max virtual machine memory (see Buffer::Open)
default open mode (editor mode) (normal, insert, command)
color pallet class
move buffer drawing to seperate class, implement scrolling, do not print past end of screen window
start in normal mode, add mode switching
add statusbar / message bar
add messagebox
make window resizeable, set default size to multiple of char size, allow only resizing to these sizes? or print black border where "extra space" is
editor should not have (buffer) _modified_ flag set when opening a blank file!
load all options from config in class constructors
create a resources class with pointers / whatever to access "resources" eg the timer (servicelocator)

2018-04-15:

1: replace all std::map<const char, const SDL_Rect> texture_chars_size by reference to FontTextureManger
2: create Textbox class
3: create CharMatrix class
4: move stuff from Buffer
5: move cursor stuff from Buffer to Textbox
6: create class for texture chars which combines textures and sizes (not required if implementation is hidden inside FontTextureManager)
7: CR does not work if not at end of line

color palette used in Window and FontTextureManager

update Window and Textbox classes so that functionality from Window is hidden in Textbox. move all "movements/actions" such as UDLR, and other key presses from Window to Textbox (implemention hiding)
