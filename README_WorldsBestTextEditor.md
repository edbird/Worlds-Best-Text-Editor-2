The worlds best text editor

Built on SDL 2, this is the Worlds Best Text Editor (or at least it will be eventually).

# Project Motivation

Very few people in the world know what VIM is. Most software engineers or programmers have probably heard of VIM, however its use it confined to the realms of a relatively small number of expert users.

Part of the reason for this is that VIM is really annoying. It is really annoying for simple reasons such as "CTRL-s doesn't save". "Copy and paste requires pressing several keys in sequence, not simply one combination", "the motion keys hjkl are not intuitive".

Yes, the small number of expert VIM users who have spent years learning VIM will disagree, but it is for this reason that VIM has remained an exclusive club of few members, with a set of users with no interest in expanding their user base with "more normies".

This is VIM for normies.

There are a few key differences from VIM.

- The editor starts in Insert Mode. You open the program, you start typing. Just like any sensible editor on the planet.

- `CTRL` works like a shortcut to VIM Normal Mode. Therefore `CTRL-s`, `CTRL-v`, `CTRL-c` all work like you expect. If you release the `CTRL` key, the editor returns to Edit Mode. (`CTRL` isn't "sticky".)

- There is still a Normal Mode. You access it by pressing `ESC`. You go back to Editor Mode by pressing `e`. `CTRL` doesn't do anything in Normal Mode.
