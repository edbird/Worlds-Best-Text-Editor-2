This is not used.

It uses std::partition_point in combination with a lambda function to perform a
search to find the number of characters which fit on a line.

I kept the source code because this is quite an interesting application of this
algorithm, although SDL provides a simpler solution in the form of
`TTF_MeasureString`.
