create_document_layout_2 has a rendering bug, cursor is placed in wrong position when end of line is close to wrapping

point to note:

either VIM style cursor wrapping should be used (cursor wraps to next line
but does not create an empty blank line/new line until text is entered)

this is a bit visually confusing

or: all lines should wrap if there is not enough space for an additional character
this is so that the cursor can be placed at one place beyond the end of each line
without wrapping
